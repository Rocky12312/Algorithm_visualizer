# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer helps to visualize different sorting algorithms like :

1) Bubble Sort <br />
2) Selection Sort <br />
3) Insertion Sort <br />
4) Merge Sort <br />
5) Quick Sort <br />
5) Heap Sort <br />

you can also change the algorithm speed and size of array with help of controller 
different color pattern is use to at different state <br />

brown color ----the block is sorted <br />
red color   ----processing the block <br />
yellow color ---at which postion the algorithm is current present at <br /> 
<br />
